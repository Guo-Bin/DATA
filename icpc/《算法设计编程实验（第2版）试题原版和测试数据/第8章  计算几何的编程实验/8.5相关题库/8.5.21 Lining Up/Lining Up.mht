<P>``How am I ever going to solve this problem?" said the pilot.=20
<P>
<P>Indeed, the pilot was not facing an easy task. She had to drop =
packages at=20
specific points scattered in a dangerous area. Furthermore, the pilot =
could only=20
fly over the area once in a straight line, and she had to fly over as =
many=20
points as possible. All points were given by means of integer =
coordinates in a=20
two-dimensional space. The pilot wanted to know the largest number of =
points=20
from the given set that all lie on one line. Can you write a program =
that=20
calculates this number?=20
<P>
<P>Your program has to be efficient!=20

<P>The input consists of <I>N</I> pairs of integers, where 1 &lt; =
<I>N</I> &lt;=20
700. Each pair of integers is separated by one blank and ended by a =
new-line=20
character. The list of pairs is ended with an end-of-file character. No =
pair=20
will occur twice.=20
