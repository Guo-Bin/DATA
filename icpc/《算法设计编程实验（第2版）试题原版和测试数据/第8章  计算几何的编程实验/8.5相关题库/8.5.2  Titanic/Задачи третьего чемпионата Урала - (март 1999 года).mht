<P align=3Djustify>It is a historical fact that during the legendary =
voyage of=20
"Titanic" the wireless telegraph machine had delivered 6 warnings about =
the=20
danger of icebergs. Each of the telegraph messages described the point =
where an=20
iceberg had been noticed. The first five warnings were transferred to =
the=20
captain of the ship. The sixth one came late at night and a telegraph =
operator=20
did not notice that the coordinates mentioned were very close to the =
