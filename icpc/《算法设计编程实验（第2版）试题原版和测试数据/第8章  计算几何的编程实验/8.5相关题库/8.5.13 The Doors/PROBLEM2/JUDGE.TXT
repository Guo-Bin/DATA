1996 ACM MID-CENTRAL REGIONAL PROGRAMMING CONTEST
PROBLEM #2 - THE DOORS

JUDGE'S NOTES

The author of this problem has stated that roundoff error resulting
from different methods of implementing the solution to this problem do
not appear to result in answers different from those reported by the
judge's solution.  I have personally tested two different programs
using different floating point data types in each, and in every case I
have always obtained the same results as the problem author's program.

I would caution those judging this problem, however, to be aware that
since floating point arithmetic is being used, representation,
precision and error are legitimate concerns.  If a solution reports
numbers which are "reasonably close" (I would suggest off by no more
than plus or minus 0.05) then the solution should be judged correct.
