Problem</A></FONT></H2>
<P>You are planning to take some rest and to go out on vacation, but you =
really=20
don't know which cities you should visit. So, you ask your parents for =
help.=20
Your mother says <I>"My son, you MUST visit Paris, Madrid, Lisboa and =
London.=20
But it's only fun in this order."</I> Then your father says: <I>"Son, if =
you're=20
planning to travel, go first to Paris, then to Lisboa, then to London =
and then,=20
at last, go to Madrid. I know what I'm talking about."</I>=20
<P>Now you're a bit confused, as you didn't expected this situation. =
You're=20
afraid that you'll hurt your mother if you follow your father's =
suggestion. But=20
you're also afraid to hurt your father if you follow you mother's =
suggestion.=20
But it can get worse, because you can hurt both of them if you simply =
ignore=20
their suggestions!=20
<P>Thus, you decide that you'll try to follow their suggestions in the =
better=20
way that you can. So, you realize that the "Paris-Lisboa-London" order =
is the=20
one which better satisfies both your mother and your father. Afterwards =
you can=20
say that you could not visit Madrid, even though you would've liked it =
very=20
much.=20
<P>If your father have suggested the "London-Paris-Lisboa-Madrid" order, =
then=20
you would have two orders, "Paris-Lisboa" and "Paris-Madrid", that would =
better=20
satisfy both of your parent's suggestions. In this case, you could only =
visit 2=20
cities.=20
<P>You want to avoid problems like this one in the future. And what if =
their=20
travel suggestions were bigger? Probably you would not find the better =
way very=20
easy. So, you decided to write a program to help you in this task. =
You'll=20
represent each city by one character, using uppercase letters, lowercase =

letters, digits and the space. Thus, you can have at most 63 different =
cities to=20
visit. But it's possible that you'll visit some city more than once.=20
<P>If you represent Paris with "a", Madrid with "b", Lisboa with "c" and =
London=20
with "d", then your mother's suggestion would be "abcd" and you father's =

suggestion would be "acdb" (or "dacb", in the second example).=20
<P>The program will read two travel sequences and it must answer how =
many cities=20
you can travel to such that you'll satisfy both of your parents and it's =

maximum.=20

<H2><FONT color=3D#0070e8><A name=3DSECTION0001003000000000000000>The=20
Input</A></FONT></H2>
<P>The input will consist on an arbitrary number of city sequence pairs. =
The end=20
of input occurs when the first sequence starts with an "#"character =
(without the=20
quotes). Your program should not process this case. Each travel sequence =
will be=20
on a line alone and will be formed by legal characters (as defined =
above). All=20
travel sequences will appear in a single line and will have at most 100 =
cities.=20

<P>For each sequence pair, you must print the following message in a =
line alone:=20
<PRE>Case #d: you can visit at most K cities.

maximum number of cities you can visit such that you'll satisfy both you =

father's suggestion and you mother's suggestion.=20
