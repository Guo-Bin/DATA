<H1>Question 1: Is Bigger Smarter?</H1>
<H2>The Problem</H2>
<P>Some people think that the bigger an elephant is, the smarter it is. =
To=20
disprove this, you want to take the data on a collection of elephants =
and put as=20
large a subset of this data as possible into a sequence so that the =
weights are=20
increasing, but the IQ's are decreasing. </P>
<P>The input will consist of data for a bunch of elephants, one elephant =
per=20
line, terminated by the end-of-file. The data for a particular elephant =
will=20
consist of a pair of integers: the first representing its size in =
kilograms and=20
the second representing its IQ in hundredths of IQ points. Both integers =
are=20
between 1 and 10000. The data will contain information for at most 1000=20
elephants. Two elephants may have the same weight, the same IQ, or even =
the same=20
weight and IQ. </P>
<P>Say that the numbers on the i-th data line are <TT>W[i]</TT> and=20
<TT>S[i]</TT>. Your program should output a sequence of lines of data; =
the first=20
line should contain a number <TT>n</TT>; the remaining <TT>n</TT> lines =
should=20
each contain a single positive integer (each one representing an =
elephant). If=20
these <TT>n</TT> integers are <TT>a[1]</TT>, <TT>a[2]</TT>,..., =
<TT>a[n]</TT>=20
then it must be the case that <PRE>   W[a[1]] &lt; W[a[2]] &lt; ... &lt; =
W[a[n]]
</PRE>and <PRE>   S[a[1]] &gt; S[a[2]] &gt; ... &gt; S[a[n]]
</PRE>In order for the answer to be correct, <TT>n</TT> should be as =
large as=20
possible. All inequalities are strict: weights must be strictly =
increasing, and=20
IQs must be strictly decreasing. There may be many correct outputs for a =
given=20
input, your program only needs to find one.=20
