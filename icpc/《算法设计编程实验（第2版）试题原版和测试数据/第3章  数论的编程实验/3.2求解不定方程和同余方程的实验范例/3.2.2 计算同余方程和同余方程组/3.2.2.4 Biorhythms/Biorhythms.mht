<P>Some people believe that there are three cycles in a person's life =
that start=20
the day he or she is born. These three cycles are the physical, =
emotional, and=20
intellectual cycles, and they have periods of lengths 23, 28, and 33 =
days,=20
respectively. There is one peak in each period of a cycle. At the peak =
of a=20
cycle, a person performs at his or her best in the corresponding field=20
(physical, emotional or mental). For example, if it is the mental curve, =
thought=20
processes will be sharper and concentration will be easier.=20
<P>
<P><BR>Since the three cycles have different periods, the peaks of the =
three=20
cycles generally occur at different times. We would like to determine =
when a=20
triple peak occurs (the peaks of all three cycles occur in the same day) =
for any=20
person. For each cycle, you will be given the number of days from the =
beginning=20
of the current year at which one of its peaks (not necessarily the =
first)=20
occurs. You will also be given a date expressed as the number of days =
from the=20
beginning of the current year. You task is to determine the number of =
days from=20
the given date to the next triple peak. The given date is not counted. =
For=20
example, if the given date is 10 and the next triple peak occurs on day =
12, the=20
answer is 2, not 3. If a triple peak occurs on the given date, you =
should give=20
the number of days to the next occurrence of a triple peak.=20

will be given=20
a number of cases. The input for each case consists of one line of four =
integers=20
<I>p</I>, <I>e</I>, <I>i</I>, and <I>d</I>. The values <I>p</I>, =
<I>e</I>, and=20
<I>i</I> are the number of days from the beginning of the current year =
at which=20
the physical, emotional, and intellectual cycles peak, respectively. The =

<I>d</I> is the given date and may be smaller than any of <I>p</I>, =
