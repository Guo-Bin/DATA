well-known trick to know if an integer N is a multiple of nine is to =
compute the=20
sum S of its digits. If S is a multiple of nine, then so is N. This is a =

recursive test, and the depth of the recursion needed to obtain the =
answer on N=20
is called the 9-degree of N.<BR><BR>Your job is, given a positive number =
N,=20
determine if it is a multiple of nine and,if it is, its =
9-degree.<BR><BR><FONT=20

is a file=20
such that each line contains a positive number. A line containing the =
number 0=20
is the end of the input. The given numbers can contain up to 1000=20
digits.<BR><BR><FONT size=3D4><B>Description of the=20
