Mileage program of ACM (Airline of Charming Merlion) is really nice for the travelers 
flying frequently. Once you complete a flight with ACM, you can earn ACMPerk miles 
in your ACM Mileage Bank depended on mileage you actual fly. In addition, you 
can use the ACMPerk mileage in your Mileage Bank to exchange free flight ticket 
of ACM in future. 
<p>The following table helps you calculate how many ACMPerk miles you can earn 
  when you fly on ACM.</p>

<p>It's shown that your ACMPerk mileage consists of two parts. One is your actual 
  flight mileage (the minimum ACMPerk mileage for Economy Class for one flight 
  is 500 miles), the other is the mileage bonus (its accuracy is up to 1 mile) 
  when you fly in Business Class and First Class. For example, you can earn 1329 
  ACMPerk miles, 1994 ACMPerk miles and 2658 ACMPerk miles for Y, B or F class 
  respectively for the fly from Beijing to Tokyo (the actual mileage between Beijing 
  and Tokyo is 1329 miles). When you fly from Shanghai to Wuhan, you can earn 
  ACMPerk 500 miles for economy class and ACMPerk 650 miles for business class 
  (the actual mileage between Shanghai and Wuhan is 433 miles).</p>
<p> Your task is to help ACM build a program for automatic calculation of ACMPerk 
  mileage.</p>
