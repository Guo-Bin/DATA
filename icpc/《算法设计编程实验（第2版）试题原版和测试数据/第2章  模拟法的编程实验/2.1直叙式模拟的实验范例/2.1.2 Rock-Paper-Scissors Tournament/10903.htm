<H2>Problem D: Rock-Paper-Scissors Tournament</H2>Rock-Paper-Scissors is game 
for two players, A and B, who each choose, independently of the other, one of 
<I>rock, paper,</I> or <I>scissors</I>. A player chosing <I>paper</I> wins over 
a player chosing <I>rock</I>; a player chosing <I>scissors</I> wins over a 
player chosing <I>paper</I>; a player chosing <I>rock</I> wins over a player 
chosing <I>scissors</I>. A player chosing the same thing as the other player 
neither wins nor loses. 
<P>A tournament has been organized in which each of <I>n</I> players plays 
<I>k</I> rock-scissors-paper games with each of the other players - 
<I>k*n*(n-1)/2</I> games in total. Your job is to compute the <I>win average</I> 
for each player, defined as <I>w / (w + l)</I> where <I>w</I> is the number of 
games won, and <I>l</I> is the number of games lost, by the player. 
<P>Input consists of several test cases. The first line of input for each case 
contains <I>1 ¡Ü n ¡Ü 100</I> <I>1 ¡Ü k ¡Ü 100</I> as defined above. For each game, 
a line follows containing p<SUB>1</SUB>, m<SUB>1</SUB>, p<SUB>2</SUB>, 
m<SUB>2</SUB>. 1 ¡Ü p<SUB>1</SUB> ¡Ü <I>n</I> and 1 ¡Ü p<SUB>2</SUB> ¡Ü <I>n</I> are 
distinct integers identifying two players; m<SUB>1</SUB> and m<SUB>2</SUB> are 
their respective moves ("rock", "scissors", or "paper"). A line containing 0 
follows the last test case. 
<P>Output one line each for player 1, player 2, and so on, through player 
<I>n</I>, giving the player's win average rounded to three decimal places. If 
the win average is undefined, output "-". Output an empty line between cases.
