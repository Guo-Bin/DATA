<P>Shoemaker has N jobs (orders from customers) which he must make. =
Shoemaker=20
can work on only one job in each day. For each i<SUB>th</SUB> job, it is =
known=20
the integer T<SUB>i</SUB> (1&lt;=3DT<SUB>i</SUB>&lt;=3D1000), the time =
in days it=20
takes the shoemaker to finish the job. For each day of delay before =
starting to=20
work for the i<SUB>th</SUB> job, shoemaker must pay a fine of =
S<SUB>i</SUB>=20
(1&lt;=3DS<SUB>i</SUB>&lt;=3D10000) cents. Your task is to help the =
shoemaker,=20
writing a programm to find the sequence of jobs with minimal total fine. =
