Assume the coasting is an infinite straight line. Land is in one side of coasting, 
sea in the other. Each small island is a point locating in the sea side. And any 
radar installation, locating on the coasting, can only cover d distance, so an 
island in the sea can be covered by a radius installation, if the distance between 
them is at most d.
<p>We use Cartesian coordinate system, defining the coasting is the x-axis. The 
  sea side is above x-axis, and the land side below. Given the position of each 
  island in the sea, and given the distance of the coverage of the radar installation, 
  your task is to write a program to find the minimal number of radar installations 
  to cover all the islands. Note that the position of an island is represented 
  by its x-y coordinates.<br>

<p><b>Input</b><br>
  <br>
  The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each case contains 
  two integers n (1 n 1000) and d, where n is the number of islands in the sea 
  and d is the distance of coverage of the radar installation. This is followed 
  by n lines each containing two integers representing the coordinate of the position 
  of each island. Then a blank line follows to separate the cases.<br>
  <br>
  The input is terminated by a line containing pair of zeros.</p>
<p><br>
  <b>Output</b></p>
<p>For each test case output one line consisting of the test case number followed 
  by the minimal number of radar installations needed. &quot;-1&quot; installation 
  means no solution for that case. </p>
