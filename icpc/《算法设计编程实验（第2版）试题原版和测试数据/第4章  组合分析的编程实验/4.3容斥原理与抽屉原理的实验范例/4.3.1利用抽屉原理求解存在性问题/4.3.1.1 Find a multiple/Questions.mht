<P align=3Djustify>The input file contains N natural (i.e. positive =
integer)=20
numbers ( N &lt;=3D 10^6 ). Each of that numbers in not greater than =
15000. This=20
numbers are not necessarily different (so it may happen that two or more =
of them=20
will be equal). Your task is to choose a few of given numbers ( 1 =
&lt;=3D few=20
&lt;=3D N ) so that the sum of chosen numbers is multiple for N (i.e. N =
=3D k*(sum=20
of chosen numbers) for some natural number k).</P>

<P align=3Djustify>The first line of the input file contains the single =

it should print the number of the chosen numbers in the first line =

the chosen numbers themselves (on a separate line each) in arbitrary =
order.</P>

properties you should print to the output file only one (preferably your =
