<P>It is 2084 and the year of Big Brother has finally arrived, albeit a =
century=20
late. In order to exercise greater control over its citizens and thereby =
to=20
counter a chronic breakdown in law and order, the Government decides on =
a=20
radical measure--all citizens are to have a tiny microcomputer =
surgically=20
implanted in their left wrists. This computer will contains all sorts of =

personal information as well as a transmitter which will allow people's=20
movements to be logged and monitored by a central computer. (A desirable =
side=20
effect of this process is that it will shorten the dole queue for =
plastic=20
surgeons.)=20
<P>
<P>An essential component of each computer will be a unique =
identification code,=20
consisting of up to 50 characters drawn from the 26 lower case letters. =
The set=20
of characters for any given code is chosen somewhat haphazardly. The =
complicated=20
way in which the code is imprinted into the chip makes it much easier =
for the=20
manufacturer to produce codes which are rearrangements of other codes =
than to=20
produce new codes with a different selection of letters. Thus, once a =
set of=20
letters has been chosen all possible codes derivable from it are used =
before=20
changing the set.=20
<P>
<P>For example, suppose it is decided that a code will contain exactly 3 =

occurrences of `<TT>a</TT>', 2 of `<TT>b</TT>' and 1 of `<TT>c</TT>', =
then three=20
of the allowable 60 codes under these conditions are:=20
<P><PRE>      abaabc
      abaacb
      ababac</PRE>
<P>These three codes are listed from top to bottom in alphabetic order. =
Among=20
all codes generated with this set of characters, these codes appear=20
consecutively in this order.=20
<P>
<P>Write a program to assist in the issuing of these identification =
codes. Your=20
program will accept a sequence of no more than 50 lower case letters =
(which may=20
contain repeated characters) and print the successor code if one exists =
or the=20
message `No Successor' if the given code is the last in the sequence for =
that=20
set of characters.=20
