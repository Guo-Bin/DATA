<h1>Problem B: Shortest Prefixes</h1>

<p>
<b>Input</b>: <tt>prefix.in</tt><br>
<b>Output</b>: <tt>prefix.out</tt>
</p>

<p>
A prefix of a string is a substring starting at the beginning of the
given string. The prefixes of "carbon" are: "c", "ca", "car", "carb",
"carbo", and "carbon".  Note that the empty string is not considered a
prefix in this problem, but every non-empty string is considered to be
a prefix of itself. In everyday language, we tend to abbreviate words
by prefixes.  For example, "carbohydrate" is commonly abbreviated by
"carb". In this problem, given a set of words, you will find for each
word the shortest prefix that uniquely identifies the word it
represents.
</p>

<p>
In the sample input below, "carbohydrate" can be abbreviated to
"carboh", but it cannot be abbreviated to "carbo"
(or anything shorter) because there are other words in the list that
begin with "carbo".
</p>

<p>
An exact match will override a prefix match. For example, the prefix
"car" matches the given word "car"
exactly. Therefore, it is understood without ambiguity that
"car" is an abbreviation for "car" , not for
"carriage" or any of the other words in the list that begins
with "car".
</p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>
The input file contains at least two, but no more than 1000 lines.
Each line contains one word consisting of 1 to 20 lower case letters.
</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>
The output file contains the same number of lines as the input
file.  Each line of the output file contains the word from the
corresponding line of the input file, followed by one blank space, and
the shortest prefix that uniquely (without ambiguity) identifies this
word.
