<h1>Problem C: Squares</h1>

<p>
<b>Input</b>: <tt>squares.in</tt><br>
<b>Output</b>: <tt>squares.out</tt>
</p>

<p>
A square is a 4-sided polygon whose sides have equal length and
adjacent sides form 90-degree angles.  It is also a polygon such that
rotating about its centre by 90 degrees gives the same polygon.  It
is not the only polygon with the latter property, however, as a
regular octagon also has this property.
</p>

<p>
So we all know what a square looks like, but can we find all possible
squares that can be formed from a set of stars in a night sky?  To
make the problem easier, we will assume that the night sky is a
2-dimensional plane, and each star is specified by its <em>x</em> and
<em>y</em> coordinates.
</p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>
The input consists of a number of test cases.  Each test case starts
with the integer <em>n</em> (1 &lt;= <em>n</em> &lt;= 1000) indicating
the number of points to follow.  Each of the next <em>n</em> lines
specify the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates (two integers) of
each point.  You may assume that the points are distinct and the
magnitudes of the coordinates are less than 20000.  The input is
terminated when <em>n</em> = 0.
</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>
For each test case, print on a line the number of squares one can form
from the given stars.
